The following fields are under discussion:

\[\[TemplateList(\^suggested-fields/.\*)\]\]\_

Once finalised, the field numbers are assigned and the page is moved
over to [the list of defined fields](../defined-fields).

Enter the field name:
\[\[NewPage(FieldTemplate,button\_label="suggest a new field",name\_template="suggested-fields/%s")\]\]\_

|/!/| Note that some fields currently have numbers assigned already,
this is due to different OSes defining different bits unilaterally. Such
mistakes should not be repeated in the future. However, even though
there are vendor namespaces, you should resist the temptation to define
globally useful fields in your own vendor namespace and propose them for
standardisation instead.

This table lists the fields some OSes assigned by bit number:
